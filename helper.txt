Here are some tips and some problems that could occur during setup and their possible fixes:

ssh bad ownership:
    1. Go to C:\Users\username.ssh
    2. Right-click the config file
    3. Properties -> Security -> Advanced -> Disable Inheritance -> Disable inheritance -> Remove all inherited permissions from this object -> Apply -> Yes -> Ok -> Ok


vscode operation not permitted:
    1. make sure you have permission to read/and write from/to the ssh config file


Setup connection from outside the Uni-network:
    - use a ProxyJump 
    - your ssh-config file should look like this: 
        Host auerkamp
          HostName auerkamp
          ProxyJump [info-account-id]@login-stud.informatik.uni-bonn.de
          User [auerkamp-username]

    -VsCode will ask you for two passwords. The first one is the password of your info-account. The second one is your auerkamp password.
